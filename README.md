# SASSpring

Spring into your new Bootstrap SASS projects with this out-of-your-way file & folder structure. All of Bootstrap's SASS is available, however only the bare minimum (grid & defaults) is imported by default.

## License

Use however you like! If you find this project useful & end up using it, it would be nice if you keep the attribution in the pre-compiled `screen.scss` file.
