## Why create a wrapper for Bootstrap?

I usually passed over using Bootstrap when I began new projects because of how large it was, and instead opted for something more focused. Somewhere along the way I came to the conclusion that I wanted to be able to utilize it and (some) of it's powerful features in a way that didn't bloat my site or require a custom download every time. I wanted a Bootstrap 'springboard' that I could use to jump headfirst into new projects. As a result, SASSpring was born.
