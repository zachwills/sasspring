# SASSpring (in development)

An opinionated wrapper by [Zach Wills](http://zachwills.net/) for Bootstrap (v3.3.0) that promotes clean and organized code.

## Getting Started

Once you pull down the project, run `npm install` so that you get all of the Grunt modules you need to be able to preprocess your SCSS. Once they install, `cd` into the `assets` directory and run `grunt` to begin watching your files.

For more in depth information, check out the wiki (coming soon).

## Why create a wrapper for Bootstrap?

I usually passed over using Bootstrap when I began new projects because of how large it was, and instead opted for something more focused. Somewhere along the way I came to the conclusion that I wanted to be able to utilize it and (some) of it's powerful features in a way that didn't bloat my site or require a custom download every time. I wanted a Bootstrap 'springboard' that I could use to jump headfirst into new projects. As a result, SASSpring was born.

## License

Use however you like! If you find this project useful & end up using it, it would be nice if you keep the attribution in the pre-compiled `screen.scss` file.
